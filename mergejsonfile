## Simple Approach to merge multiple JSON file
## Assume the files on the same path

def cat_json(output_filename, input_filenames):
    with open(output_filename, "w") as outfile:
        first = True
        for infile_name in input_filenames:
            with open(infile_name) as infile:
                if first:
                    outfile.write('[')
                    first = False
                else:
                    outfile.write(',')
                outfile.write(infile.read())
        outfile.write(']')

print("File Merging started....")
cat_json("result.json",["1.json","2.json","3.json"])
print("File Merging ended....")
